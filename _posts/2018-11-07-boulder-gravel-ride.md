This past Saturday Sara and I spent a perfect fall day on our bikes exploring some mellow singletrack and gravel roads around Boulder.

It was raining the entire time we drove from Golden to Boulder and we were not super optimistic about what the day had in store for us. Howevever, the weather promptly cleared and made way for a crisp, clear day.

Until Saturday, most of my bike riding around Boulder had consisted of riding straight into the hills as quickly as possible. We took a different tact on Saturday and seeked dirt roads and gravel-bike-friendly singletrack on the praire east of town. With exception of a few hike-a-bikes, we definitely found what we were looking for! To top it off, we saw approximately one million prairie dogs!

Nearly every time I go out on my bike I am amazed by the new terrain I find. This time was no exception and it was great to share the exploration with Sara.
