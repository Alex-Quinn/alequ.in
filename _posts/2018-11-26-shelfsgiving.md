After celebrating Thanksgiving early this year, Sara and I found ourselves with a free four-day weekend. The original plan was to trek out to the desert to meet Dan for another bikepacking trip. But, as the weekend got closer, the weather and the logistics were not cooperating. We bailed.

In all honesty, I was also ready to do something other than ride bikes for a few days. It is perfect climbing season in the desert and I was missing out. Sara and I left the bikes at home Thanksgiving morning and drove south to Shelf Road to clip some bolts.

Neither Sara or I had climbed much at all recently. Fortunately, this left me feeling free from the goals that plagued my motivation for climbing in the first half of the year. My goal for the weekend was simply to have fun and hopefully stay relatively warm at night. I think we achieved both!

We mostly stuck to moderate (and fun!) climbing but I did try a few hard-for-me routes. I felt a lack of finger strength compared to ~6 months ago but, surprisingly, the climbing flowed well and felt intuitive. One route that stuck out was [_The Big Chill (5.10c)_](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105748978/the-big-chill). The route is a nice combination of  finger cracks, technical face climbing, and steep pocket-pulling. I’ll definitely be back!

I didn’t redpont anything noteworthy but I was reminded of why I keep coming back to climbing. Climbing forces you to actively grapple with uncertainty and doubt in a way that is absent from activities like mountain biking. The process is certainly uncomfortable and, I suspect, why a lot of people give up climbing over time. I'm working to not give in quite yet and, with a bit of a fire lit, I am hoping that the weather allows for a few more rounds on the rock this winter.
