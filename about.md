Hi!

<p>
I'm a software engineer focused on finding elegant solutions to complex problems. I work primarily as a backend web engineer with expertise in <b>highly available systems, application scaling, and data administration.</b>
</p>

<p>
I believe in using technology to provide humans with solutions to real problems. <b>I do not build applications solely for the sake of profit.</b> If you have a project that you think might fit that bill (even if it's outsite of my listed expertise), <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/contact">get in touch!</a>
</p>

<p>
Aside from building software, I am an avid rock climber and cyclist. I love being outside and travelling as much as possible. I work remotely from various places around the Unites States. Let me known where you are; I would love to meet in person.
</p>
