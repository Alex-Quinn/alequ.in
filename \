Hi!

<p>
I'm a software consultant focused on finding elegant solutions to complex problems. I work primarily as a backend enginner with expertise in <b>highly available systems, application scaling, and service-oriented architectures.</b>
</p>

<p>
I believe in using technology as a tool to provide humans with solutions to real problems. <b>I do not build applications solely for the sake of profit.</b> If you have a project that you think might fit that bill (even if it's outsite of my listed expertise), get in touch!
</p>

<p>
Aside from building software, I am an avid rock climber and cyclist. I love being outside and travelling as much as possible. I work remotely from various spots around the Unites States. Let me known where you are, I would love to meet in person.
</p>
