Over the past few months, Dan and I have texted back and forth trying to pin down some sort of adventure but action proved elusive. Weather, jobs, and lack of motivation all seemed to get in the way.

I wrote off the whole idea as the fall days starting feeling more like winter. Meanwhile, good ol’ Dan O’Talian bought a new bike, a set of shiny bikepacking bags, and some motivation to get outside. I suspect that I got a text the minute after he clicked  “Complete Order”. Now we _had_ to do something!

Sara and I had already been scouting routes in an area around Grand Junction called the “Wild Horses Range”. The range is covered in plenty of old mining roads and ATV trails. Plus, there was a chance we’d see wild horses! We decided on a relatively casual overnight loop and planned on meeting Saturday morning in the bustling metropolis of DeBeque, CO.

Saturday’s ride took us through mostly scrubby desert terrain. A gravel road slowly turned into dirt and eventually into ATV double-track. We set a casual pace and took the time to catch up on life. Sara and I talked about settling into our “new life” in Golden and Dan told us about Emily’s grueling med-school schedule.

Towards the end of our day’s ride I informed Sara and Dan that there was a section of our route where the road “disappeared” in all of the satellite images I had looked at. When scouting the route, I found a vague indication of a tail but I wasn’t sure what we’d find. Of course, when we arrived at the “trail”, there was only sand and sagebrush. I guess a bikepacking trip isn’t complete without at least one gnarly hike-a-bike! We dragged our bikes up a sandy drainage and followed the GPS track for a mile or so before dropping back onto the main road. From there, we rode a few more miles until cruising into our campsite for the night.

After a _very_ cold night, we woke up around 6 AM to a chilly morning. Sara re-lit the fire from the previous night and we took our time warming up and waiting for the sun to rise a bit before getting back on our bikes. We rode out of camp at 8 AM with all of our layers still on. We each set our own pace and mostly rode separately. I think the cold dampened our desire to chat. 

I was riding ahead of Sara and Dan cruising down a fast downhill section when I turned and looked up to see a group of wild horses right in front of me! I slammed on my brakes and skidded to stop. The horses stared at me trying to decide if I was more interesting than their breakfast. Breakfast won. I tried to be quiet as Sara and Dan caught up to the scene. I long decided that the likelihood of seeing wild horses on our short trip was pretty low but here they were! Mission accomplished!

The rest of our ride proved to be more demanding than the previous day. The challenging terrain served better scenery though. We were surrounded by red slick rock, mountains, and maze-like drainages. It was so cold that I wore my down jacket for the entire ride but it was worth it to be out exploring in the desert.

We arrived back at our cars unscathed and psyched for the next trip. Sara and I turned towards the snowy Rockies and Dan made his way back into the desert towards Utah. It was a quick trip but a perfect reminder that adventures can be had on the weekend and that spending time with good friends is always better than staying home.
