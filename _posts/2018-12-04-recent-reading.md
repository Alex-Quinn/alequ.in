### [To Shake The Sleeping Self](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35356383-to-shake-the-sleeping-self)

As he turned 30, Jedidiah Jenkins set out on a bike touring trip from Oregon to Patagonia. Jedidiah, being a devote Christian and having never really ridden a bike before, is a bit of a divergence from the typical “adventurer” that I find myself reading about. He couldn’t even clip into his pedals on day one!

However, for me, the book was less about “serious” adventure and more about Jedidiah questioning his religion, his life’s path, and his sexuality. Reconciling being a devote Christian and being gay is core to the narrative. The book left me feeling both excited to get out on the bike and reflective. Definitely worth a read.

### [Between The World And Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me)

This book has spent a long time on my to-read list. Many consider it “required reading”. Honestly though, I felt uneasy with the subject matter—being black in America. What unanswerable questions would the book uncover? What would it say about me, a representative white man? It turns out that I was right to be intimidated.

In the form of a letter to the author’s son, _Between the World and Me_ presents a clear-eyed view of the American dream as an institution built on the destruction of non-white folks . Coates is angry that, by virtue of his blackness, he was born into dire circumstances: neighborhood violence, an uncaring school system, police brutality. The list goes on. These circumstances are not born out of an unfortunate human diversion (i.e. racism). Rather, they are foundational in realizing the American dream. The book closes by arguing that not only is the American dream oppressing non-“dreamers” but it is destroying the planet.

This book left me with more questions than answers. Still, it is unquestionably useful. Like a lot of people, I’ve developed a suspicion of the American dream as the path to contentment. This book taught me that, in addition to leaving “dreamers” with snake oil, the pursuit of happiness is mirrored by destruction just out of view. What am I to do with that? I’m not so sure.

### [JL Collin's Stock Series (Blog)](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/)

When it comes to personal finance, I strongly believe that if you are able to live below your means the rest is just details. I am certain that JL (Jim?) Collins would agree. However, if you’re interested in what those details might look like, this series of posts is hard to beat.

Collins takes a hard line against guessing market trends, managed funds, and other “standard” investment advice. The typical script generates a lot of money for the financial industry but not necessarily the average investor. Instead, he explains in clear terms a simple approach to investing that leans heavily on long-term thinking and data-based decision-making.

Admittedly, if someone isn’t interested in all of the detail, the entire series can be summed up in a single piece of advice: “invest in Vanguard index funds (VTSAX)”. However, I find the depth and reasoning interesting. The complexity of the market economy—and finance more broadly—is mind-boggling. These posts do a nice job at distilling some of that chaos into actionable bits for the average person.
