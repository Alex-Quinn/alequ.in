Hi!

<p>
<b>I'm a software engineer focused on helping organizations find solutions to unique technical problems.</b> I understand that all software has quirks and legacy code is not perfect. I work with each client to understand their particular project and build custom software tailored to the problem at hand.
</p>

<p>
Most of my expertise is as a backend web engineer with a focus on <b>application scaling, highly available systems, and data management.</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm here when technical challenges begin to hinder your organization's ability to do what it's good at. If you'd like to chat, <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/contact">get in touch!</a>
