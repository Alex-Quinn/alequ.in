It can be difficult to get outside during the time between holidays each year. Calendars are packed,  days are short, and the weather rarely cooperates. A voice in the back of my head is usually quick to say “You’ll get back at it in January”. Luckily, this year was different. Due to the easy motivation that comes from spending time with good company, I found myself in the snow instead of sitting at home.

## Quandary Peak

Last weekend Sara and I tagged along with two friends to attempt Sara and I’s first winter ascent of a 14er. Sara had spent some time up high throughout the summer but I hadn’t been to 14,000 ft in quite a while— let alone in the winter. I mostly avoid “mountaineering” outings due to objective hazards, an unwillingness to drive in the snow, and the general unpleasantness of being cold. Fortunately, our guides for the day had spent a lot of time on snowy mountains (and were willing to drive). Jackpot!

Our objective was Quandary peak which was a perfect choice for a relaxed day out. The round trip is only 7ish miles and the trail follows a low-angle ridge to the summit. The first half of the ascent was a mellow walk through the woods which opened up to a snow field and a blue bird day.

Above tree-line the mountain showed a different face. The wind picked up dramatically and the temperature dropped. I put on warm gloves and tried to guard any exposed skin from the wind. We were about half-way up and in front of us was a steep exposed slope guarding the summit. Suddenly the day felt pretty full-on.

Sara and Jenn decided that they were satisfied with the day and turned around. Justin and I continued to the summit. The hike to the top proved to be cold but not quite as steep as it looked from below. We tagged the summit, snapped a photo, and hurried down to escape the cold.

It was rad hanging out with Justin on the way down. We talked about plans for more adventures, ultra-running, and balancing day jobs against time spent outside. I was reminded of how refreshing spending time in the mountains with friends can be. Also, it turns out that mountaineering objectives don’t have to be dangerous and scary.

## Rocky Mountain National Park

The following weekend Sara’s friends from Chicago, Josh and Brooke, visited from Austin, TX. Brooke is dealing with a foot injury so we didn’t want to get too radical but we did want to show them “real” Colorado mountains. We decided that Rocky Mountain National Park was the perfect place.

I had never been to the park in winter and it was impressive! The hike we chose was a lollipop which made a loop around a frozen lake. On the way to the lake, we could see the Diamond, the Petit Grepon, and plenty of other craggy mountains that I didn’t recognize. You can really feel the seriousness of those mountains when they are wind blown and covered in snow.

When we made it to the lake, we of course stopped for a bit to “test the ice”. This intricate procedure involves stomping as hard as possible in every available section of frozen lake. I’m happy to report that the lake was solid.

After our hike, we finished out the day with a meal at the climber-run Ed’s Cantina in Estes Park. The only regret from the day was not factoring in the closing time of the local pie shop into our schedule. We’ll get it next time!
