It’s been very cold in Colorado for the last week or so. Sitting inside hiding from the cold and the fact that it is a new year, have both inspired me to start dreaming about 2019 adventures. Most of my outings in the last year have been primarily focused on exploring the classics in Colorado and getting a lay of the land. Thinking ahead to the long summer days of 2019, I’m hoping to take a more creative approach. Linking up trail systems, interesting bikepacking routes, and  approaching out-of-the-way climbs by bike are all on my mind.

Alas, it is still January and there is  a long, dark winter ahead. Some adventures will have to wait.

Even still, we were blessed with some primo weather today and I was eager to try something new. I strapped my running shoes to my bike and pointed my wheel uphill. The goal was to ride to Golden Gate Canyon State Park, run a bit, and ride back home.

The last time I rode to Golden Gate was when I had just moved to Golden and the ride felt _hard_.  The climb felt like it never ended and I definitely didn’t have a good time. Luckily I’ve been on my bike a lot more since then so the ascent into the park felt surprisingly casual.

Running, on the other hand, did feel hard. I have never done any real running after riding a bike and I gained an appreciation for triathlons today. My legs felt like noodles and  I had to take my time on technical terrain. In addition to noodle legs, my mind could not settle in with the quiet of the woods. Even though the park is only a 30 minute drive from Golden it remains relatively uncrowded and feels pretty wild. This is especially true in the winter when it is usually ~10 degrees colder than in town which deters most visitors. I couldn’t shake the image of a mountain lion pouncing on me at any moment. That's how some days go though and nonetheless I made it to the top of Windy Peak in good spirits.

The ride home was relatively uneventful as I’ve ridden the road down a handful of times at this point. I was toying with extending my ride until I hit the climb up Drew Hill Road which culminates in an 18% grade. After mashing my pedals up that hill, I was content with coasting back into town where a hot shower waited.

Overall, I had a great day and it feels super cool to switch things up a bit. The day got me psyched about things to come this year. Golden Gate Park in particular has some long technical climbing which could be perfect for linkups off the bike. We’ll see what the year brings!
